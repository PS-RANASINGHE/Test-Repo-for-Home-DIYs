### Celestial Phenomena  
Finland’s location above the Arctic Circle grants two extraordinary natural shows:

1. **Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis)**  
   - Visible from late August through April on clear nights.  
   - Best viewing sites: remote wilderness lodges around Inari, Kakslauttanen, and Kilpisjärvi.

2. **Midnight Sun**  
   - June and early July bring continuous daylight—perfect for hiking, fishing, or midnight golf.
